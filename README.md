### Game Rules

1-4 players

Shuffle deck, Player who pooed most recently goes first.

Place the desk in the middle of the players. Clockwise game play.

Each player picks up a card and adds it to their pile.

If you pick up a ‘Release’ Card you are out of the game. Count up your Pootential Points.

Keep going until everyone has released. Player with most Pootential points wins.

Action cards have stated action on card.

Discarded cards should be added to a ‘toilet’ pile.

If a draw in points happens draw a card and add that to your total. If you draw an action card discard it and draw another card until you draw a food card.

### Drinking Game Rules

#### Drink on drinks

Everytime you get a drink card, you drink

#### Higher or Lower

Place the cards upside down, fip a card upwards. Then guess the next card to be higher or lower, then flip. If a correct guess Well Done, if wrong DRINK!

## Risks and challenges

We don't foresee risks as of now as the project has been self-funded till now, as a project that we are really keen on creating for everyone to enjoy, and a brainchild that we want to see come alive!

Simply put, we will do everything in our power to release this big poo-tential.
